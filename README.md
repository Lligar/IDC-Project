# Project IDC
An android prototype project started for intention of Portfolio usage.  
IDC Stands for Idle Dungeon Crawler

## Project Goal
#### I started this project for the following reasons.
1. See if I can publish a game onto Google Playstore.
2. Feel the pain of the procedures and difficulties of publishing a game.
3. To have my creative juice fresh and flowing.
4. An actual complete game for Portfolio.

## Game Overview
The main concept of the game is a Turn-Based Idle Game that simulates battle on a grid style field. Player character and enemy will take turns to fight. While the enemy will follow a fairly simple logic, the player character will follow a rather more complex logic created by the user. The user will create a set of logic with available skills. Every skill has movement range, attack range and cooldown timer.  

> This part of logic can be freely edited by the player  
> Ex1. Check if enemy is within range of "Y1" and use "Y1" if returns false.  
> Ex2. Check if enemy is within range of "Y2" and use "Y2" if returns true.


Every turn the player will search which skill to use following the logic above.


## Gameplay
To keep the playstyle simple and fully enjoyable to mobile phones all battles will be done automatically.  
With the exception of setting the logic part where it should be done manually.
