# Project IDC
An android prototype project started for intention of Portfolio usage.  
IDC Stands for Idle Dungeon Crawler

## Project Goal
#### I started this project for the following reasons.
1. See if I can publish a game onto Google Playstore.
2. Feel the pain of the procedures and difficulties of publishing a game.
3. To have my creative juice fresh and flowing.
4. An actual complete game for Portfolio.

## Game Overview
The main concept of the game is an Idle game that would *look like* a classic dungeon crawler game like 3DO's Might and Magic series or Westwood Associates' Eye of the Beholder.  
Like most games nowadays this game have that special *but* feature to the game as well.  
*But* the battle system is excecuted automatically with some 'if' conditions.

> This part of logic can be freely edited by the player  
> ex.1 Use skill "Y1"  
> ex.2 If Enemy Count is more than "X" use skill "Y3"  
> ex.3 If Health is below 50% use skill "Y2"  
> ex.4 Use skill "Y4"

Every turn the player will search which skill to use following the logic above.
> Use "Y1" whenever possible.  

> Check if enemy count is more than "X" and "Y3" is available.  
> > If true = use "Y3"  

> Check if player health is below 50%  
> > If true = use "Y2"  

> Use "Y4" if all else is false

## Gameplay
To keep the playstyle simple and fully enjoyable to mobile phones all battles will be done automatically.  
With the exception of setting the logic part where it should be done manually.
