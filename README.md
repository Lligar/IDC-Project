# Project IDC
An android prototype project started for intention of Portfolio usage.  
IDC Stands for Idle Dungeon Crawler

## Project Goal
#### I started this project for the following reasons.
1. See if I can publish a game onto Google Playstore.
2. Feel the pain of the procedures and difficulties of publishing a game.
3. To have my creative juice fresh and flowing.
4. An actual complete game for Portfolio.

## Game Overview
The main concept of the game is a Turn-Based Idle Game that simulates battle like the 3DO's classic Might and Magic series or Sir-Tech's Wizardry. Quiet similar to the classic games the enemy and player character takes turn to attack each other. 
> This part of logic can be freely edited by the player  
>   
> Ex0. If enemy is planning to attack this turn use "Block".  
> Ex1. Check enemy number and use skill Y1 if returns true.  
> Ex2. Use linked skill Y2.  
> Ex3. Use skill Y2-1 if used Y2 last turn.  
> Ex4. Use skill H1 if health below 50%.  
> Ex5. Use skill Y3.  

Every turn the player will search which skill to use following the logic above.  
The higher the logic is, the higher the priority of the skill.
